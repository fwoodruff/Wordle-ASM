# Wordle-ASM
A command line program for Wordle colouring written in x86 assembly

This program takes as input two words, a target and a candidate.
It then colours the candidate according to the rules of Wordle.
Words with double letter s slightly complicate the logic.
This is a tiny but non-trivial project to learn x86 assembly.
